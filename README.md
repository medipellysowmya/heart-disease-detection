# Heart Disease Prediction

## About The Project

Heart disease prediction is a crucial aspect of preventive healthcare that involves the comprehensive analysis of diverse data points to evaluate an individual's susceptibility to cardiovascular diseases. This project utilizes machine learning algorithms to process demographic and clinical data—including age, gender, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels—to stratify individuals into risk categories. The goal is to enable timely interventions and personalized preventive strategies.

The application provides a user-friendly interface built with Streamlit, allowing users to input their health metrics and receive an instant prediction generated by a trained machine learning model.

## Dataset Attributes

The dataset comprises 13 features used to predict the target variable (presence or absence of heart disease):
 - **Age**: Age in years
 - **Sex**: 1 = male; 0 = female
 - **CP**: Chest pain type (0-3)
 - **Trestbps**: Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission)
 - **Chol**: Serum cholestoral in mg/dl
 - **FBS**: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false)
 - **Restecg**: Resting electrocardiographic results (0-2)
 - **Thalach**: Maximum heart rate achieved
 - **Exang**: Exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
 - **Oldpeak**: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
 - **Slope**: The slope of the peak exercise ST segment (0-2)
 - **CA**: Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
 - **Thal**: Thalassemia (0-3)
 - **Target**: 1 = Heart Disease Prediction, 0 = No Heart Disease

## Built With

 - **Python**: Core programming language
 - **Streamlit**: Web application framework
 - **Scikit-Learn**: Machine learning library
 - **Pandas & Numpy**: Data manipulation and analysis
 - **Seaborn & Matplotlib**: Data visualization
 - **Flask**: (Alternative backend support)
 - **DVC**: Data Version Control

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/medipellysowmya/heart-disease-detection.git
   cd Heart-Disease-Prediction-main
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (Recommended)
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   # Windows
   .\env\Scripts\activate
   # Linux/Mac
   source env/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Application

1. **Start the Streamlit App**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
   Or if the `streamlit` command is not found:
   ```bash
   python -m streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. **Access the App**
   The application will automatically open in your default browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

### Training the Model (Optional)

If you wish to retrain the model:
1. Ensure your data is located in `Notebook_Experiments/Data/heart.csv`.
2. Run the training pipeline:
   ```bash
   python src/Heart/pipeline/Training_pipeline.py
   ```
   *Note: If you encounter module errors, ensure `PYTHONPATH` is set correctly.*
